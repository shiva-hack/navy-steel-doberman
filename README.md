# üåê Rails-React Q&A Application: OpenAI-Powered PDF Analysis

This Rails-React application uniquely combines the powerful backend capabilities of Rails with the dynamic frontend features of React. Its primary function is to analyze and process PDF manuscripts, allowing users to ask questions and receive answers generated by OpenAI technology. The application excels in comprehending intricate codebases, utilizing APIs for complex tasks, and smoothly fusing Rails with React for an enhanced user experience.

## üîó Public URL

- The project could be publicly accessed at https://navy-steel-doberman.onrender.com.

## üéØ Core Features

- **üìÑ Advanced PDF Processing**: Utilizing the [`pdf_embed.rake`](/lib/tasks/pdf_embed.rake) script, the app expertly formats a PDF file, extracts its text, and segments it into manageable chunks. These chunks are then stored in a PostgreSQL database for efficient retrieval. We demonstrate this using [`blog.pdf`](/lib/assets/blog.pdf), a thought-provoking article on Engineering Excellence.

- **üîç Intelligent Backend Query Handling**: The application's backend smartly fetches the most relevant text segments from the database in response to user queries. These segments are then sent to OpenAI, which crafts accurate and context-aware answers.

- **üñ•Ô∏è Intuitive Frontend Experience**: The [`ChatInterface.jsx`](/app//javascript/react/src/components/ChatInterface.jsx) component, styled with Tailwind CSS, offers a clean and user-friendly chat interface. This enriches user interaction and query handling.

## üîë Key Files

- [`ChatInterface.jsx`](/app//javascript/react/src/components/ChatInterface.jsx): The core of the React frontend, mounted using [`remount`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/remount).
- [`pdf_embed_controller.rb`](/app/controllers/pdf_embed_controller.rb): Manages the embedding process of the PDF file.
- [`questions_controller.rb`](/app/controllers/questions_controller.rb): Handles user queries and interactions.

## üö¶ Application Routes

- POST `/questions/ask`: A specialized route for submitting questions.
- POST `/questions`: Allows posting of new questions.
- GET `/questions`: Displays all posted questions.
- DELETE `/questions/:id`: Removes a specific question.
- GET `/up`: A health check endpoint confirming application status.
- GET `/`: The primary entry point of the app, leading to the home controller's index action.

## üõ†Ô∏è Setting Up

Follow these instructions to get the application running on your local machine for development and testing.

### üìã Requirements

- Ruby (version in [`.ruby-version`](.ruby-version))
- Rails (version in [`Gemfile`](Gemfile))
- PostgreSQL with pgvector (Docker setup command provided)
  ```bash
  docker run -d -p 5432:5432 -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=postgres --name my_gpt_postgres ankane/pgvector
  ```

### üß∞ Installation Process

Clone the repository, then execute these commands in the project directory:

**Install Dependencies**

```bash
bundle install
```

**Database Setup**

```bash
rails db:create
rails db:migrate
```

**Edit Credentials to set the OpenAI secrets**
```bash
rails credentials:edit
```

**Start Development Server**

```bash
./bin/dev
```

The application is now accessible at http://localhost:3000.

## üìò PDF Embedding Instructions

To process and embed a PDF into the database, use:

```bash
./bin/rake "pdf:embed[filepath]"
```

_Note: Replace "filepath" with your PDF file's path._

## üóíÔ∏è Repository Setup

This project was initiated using:

```bash
rails new navy-steel-doberman --database=postgresql --css=tailwind -j=esbuild
```
